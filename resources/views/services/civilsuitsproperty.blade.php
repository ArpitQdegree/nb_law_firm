    <h1>Civil Suits In Property</h1>

    <p>One significant category of small claims disputes involves property damage cases. Usually, these cases involve claims that the defendant negligently caused damage to the plaintiff’s property. Less often, the plaintiff may claim that the defendant acted intentionally in causing damage to the plaintiff’s property. If you own a property that has been damaged by another person or by a force of nature, chances are that you won’t turn first to small claims court to cover your loss. That’s because virtually all landowners have property insurance, primarily because most owners have a mortgage or a loan secured by the land. We here at NB Law Firm ensure that we put our knowledge so that your needs are fulfilled and the best alternative is done so that the clients are satisfied.</p>
