    <h1 class="text">Civil Suits For Partition</h1>

    <p>Partition means division of property between two or more co-owners. Partition of property in India takes place either through a partition deed or family settlement agreement. A co-owner can also file a suit for partition in court.</p>

    <p>There are several modes of dividing a jointly-owned property between the co-owners, depending upon the fact whether the property is:</p>

    <p>&#8594;Divided with mutual consent of all the co-owners.</p>
    <p>&#8594;Divided on dispute/demand by one or more co-owners.</p>

    <p>Before a court case is filed for partition of property in India, we help you send a legal notice to the other co-owners regarding family property partition. The legal notice for partition suit must include the shares of each co-owner, details of the property in dispute and the action required to be taken. If the co-owners do not respond to the legal notice or send insufficient reply, a partition suit can be filed.</p>
