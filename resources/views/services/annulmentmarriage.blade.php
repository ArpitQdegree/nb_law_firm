    <h1>Annulment of Marriage Case</h1>

    <p>Annulment of Marriage Case Law Firm Delhi – Annulment is a legal procedure for declaring a marriage null and void. With the exception of bigamy and not meeting the minimum age requirement for marriage, it is rarely granted. A marriage can be declared null and void if certain legal requirements were not met at the time of the marriage. If these legal requirements were not met then the marriage is not considered to have existed in the eyes of the law. This process is called annulment. It is very different from divorce in that while a divorce dissolves a marriage that has existed, a marriage that is annulled never existed at all. Thus unlike divorce, an annulled marriage is considered never to have existed. The advocates here make sure that this process is completed in a way that causes the least problems to the client’s emotions.</p>
