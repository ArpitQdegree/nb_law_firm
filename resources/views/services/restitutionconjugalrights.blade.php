    {{-- <h1>Restitution Of Conjugal Rights</h1><br> --}}

    <p>Marriage is administered by Personal laws which administer the terms like divorce, maintenance, custody and restitution of conjugal rights.</p><br>
    <p>It can be regarded as the rights and privileges (as to love, affection, sexual relations, companionship, comfort, and services) implied by and involved in the marriage relationship. If either the husband or the wife withdraws from the society of the other, without reasonable excuse, the aggrieved party may approach the Court for restitution of conjugal rights. The firm assures excellence and accuracy while dealing with such matters.</p>
