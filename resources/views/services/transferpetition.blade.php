    <h1 class="text">Transfer Petition</h1>

    <p>In the majority of cases, this provision is invoked in married matters and frequently at the instance of the partner once she is clothed as a respondent in the proceedings initiated by the husband and in cases wherever the parties have separated for married variations and are living in several states. In these types of cases, the partner moves for transfer of the proceedings on the bottom of her inability to defend the proceedings for being not during a position to afford travelling, being not during a position to not leave her child/children behind and on the grounds her personal safety and inconvenience besides expenses. The Court invariably takes a sympathetic read in favour of the partner but, thatâ€™s continuously not the case as in some cases the Supreme Court has control that the convenience of the petitioner cannot eclipse the necessity of justice. NB Law firm has several years of experience in dealing with such matters.</p>
