    <h1>498A & Allied Criminal Proceedings</h1>

    <p>The section was enacted to combat the menace of dowry deaths. It was introduced in the code by the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1983 (Act 46 of 1983). By the same Act section 113-A has been added to the Indian Evidence Act to raise presumption regarding abetment of suicide by married woman. The main objective of section 498-A of I.P.C is to protect a woman who is being harassed by her husband or relatives of husband. We provide our expertise service in this regard in defending as well as prosecuting the case. We have vast court experience in these type of proceedings.</p>
